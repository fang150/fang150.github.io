I give myself an epsilon of relaxation from my constrained mind (or conditioned mind) to determine the next step, and sometimes randomly sample the action space. I then measure the outcomes through my six senses, which have limited throughput, filtered by my biased beliefs, and see how it goes.


Btw, youtube randomly jumps to  [The live concert from Maggie Rogers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTQym67anMk&list=RD9YbkKl4q-jk&index=4) after I was searching the Six Musical, and it's great.
