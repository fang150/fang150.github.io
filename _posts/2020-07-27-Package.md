Today I finally received the package from my family.<br/>
Texted my mom, no response. It's been a week.<br/>
Texted my older brother, he said she's okay. I couldn't believe it.<br/>
He called her, and we realized that she broke her cellphone so that she couldn't read my text. <br/>
I relieved, or rather, collapsed.<br/>
I never realized how much I care about her.<br/>
No, I already knew. <br/>

Good News:<br/>
My brother got his job as a math teacher in an excellent junior high school. Congrats to him. We both are growing up.
