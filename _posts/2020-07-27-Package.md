Today I finally received the package from my family.\ 
Texted my mom, no response. It's been a week.\
Texted my older brother, he said she's okay. I don't believe it.\
He called her, and we realized that she broke her older cellphone so that she couldn't read my text. I relieved, or rather, collapsed.\ 
I never realized how much I care about her.\ 
No, I already knew. Today, it's just deepen my belief.\

Good News: 
My brother got his job as a math teacher in an excellent junior high school. Congrats to him. We both are growing up.
