There was a doordash mis delivery today, the context was that the doordasher couldn't find my address exactly so he/she just randomly took a picture nearby my neighbor and put my items to my neighbor's house and claimed the success of delivery. Below was the conversation, and I think I did the right thing (feel free to let me know  if I could have been done better):

<div style=" display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr)); gap: 20px; align-items: start; "> <figure style="margin: 0;"> <figcaption style="margin: 0 0 8px 0; font-weight: 700;">Pic 1</figcaption> <img src="/images/doordash_1.PNG" alt="Pic 1" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"> </figure> <figure style="margin: 0;"> <figcaption style="margin: 0 0 8px 0; font-weight: 700;">Pic 2</figcaption> <img src="/images/doordash_2.PNG" alt="Pic 2" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"> </figure> <figure style="margin: 0;"> <figcaption style="margin: 0 0 8px 0; font-weight: 700;">Pic 3</figcaption> <img src="/images/doordash_3.PNG" alt="Pic 3" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"> </figure> <figure style="margin: 0;"> <figcaption style="margin: 0 0 8px 0; font-weight: 700;">Pic 4</figcaption> <img src="/images/doordash_4.PNG" alt="Pic 4" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"> </figure> </div>

One thought came to my mind from this event is that it is true that "**children speaks in the passive voice when they don't like happens**" , and **they can be very righteous about it**. see [ (The Importance of Authentic Communication by Sheryl Sandberg) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nRENaRCvLI), starting from 3:00. 

One last thought for me is that I cannot let this event dictate my emotion for the entire day, so just let it go.
