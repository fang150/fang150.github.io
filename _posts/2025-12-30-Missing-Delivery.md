There was a doordash mis delivery today, the context was that the doordasher couldn't find my address exactly so he/she just randomly took a picture nearby my neighbor and put my items to my neighbor's house and claimed the success of delivery. Below was the conversation, and I think I did the right thing (feel free to let me know  if I could have been done better):

<div style="
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
  align-items: start;
">

  <figure style="margin: 0;">
    <img src="/images/doordash_1.PNG" alt="Pic 1" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 8px; font-size: 0.95em;"><b>Pic 1</b></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure style="margin: 0;">
    <img src="/images/doordash_2.PNG" alt="Pic 2" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 8px; font-size: 0.95em;"><b>Pic 2</b></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure style="margin: 0;">
    <img src="/images/doordash_3.PNG" alt="Pic 3" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 8px; font-size: 0.95em;"><b>Pic 3</b></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure style="margin: 0;">
    <img src="/images/doordash_4.PNG" alt="Pic 4" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 8px; font-size: 0.95em;"><b>Pic 4</b></figcaption>
  </figure>

</div>


One thought came to my mind from this event is that it is true that "children speaks in the passive voice when they don't like happens" see [The Importance of Authentic Communication by Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nRENaRCvLI), starting from 3:00. 

One last thought for me is that I cannot let this event dictate my emotion for the entire day, so just let it go.
