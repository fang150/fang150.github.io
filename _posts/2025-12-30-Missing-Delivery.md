There was a doordash mis delivery today, the context was that the doordasher couldn't find my address exactly so he/she just randomly took a picture nearby my neighbor and put my items to my neighbor's house and claimed the success of delivery. Below was the conversation, and I think I did the right thing (feel free to let me know  if I could have been done better):

One thought came to my mind from this event is that it is true that "children speaks in the passive voice when they don't like happens" see [The Importance of Authentic Communication by Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nRENaRCvLI), starting from 3:00. 

One last thought for me is that I cannot let this event dictate my emotion for the entire day, so just let it go.
