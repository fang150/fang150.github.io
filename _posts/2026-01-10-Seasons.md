Life moves in seasons.

Spring whispers: **begin**.

Summer demands: **endure**.

Fall offers: **receive**.

Winter invites: **recover**.

But seasons don’t always arrive gently—sometimes the heat breaks, and winter comes early. We have to adapt quickly.

And each person moves through different seasons across the seven dimensions of life—and so do the people around us. Learn to recognize them, listen to them, celebrate them, and learn from them. Let different seasons call forth **empathy and compassion**, not the cheap dopamine of putting others down or comparing your season to theirs - this does not give us healthy happiness in anyway.

Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear
Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?
In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles
In laughter, in strife
In five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
How do you measure a year in the life?
How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
How do you measure the life of a woman or a man?
It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends
Remember the love
Remember the love, remember the love (oh, love)
Love (oh, give me love now)
Measure in love
(Measure in love
Measure in love
Seasons of love)
Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes (seasons of love)
Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear (moments so dear)
Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes (seasons of love)
How do you measure, measure a year?
Measure in love (love), sweet love (love)
Seasons of love, oh yeah
Love (love), sweet love (love)
Seasons of love
Love (love), sweet love (love)
Seasons of love
Measure your life in
Seasons of love
Yeah, oh

```

Follow, follow the sun
And which way the wind blows
When this day is done
Breath, breath in the air
Set your intentions
Dream with care
Tomorrow is a new day for everyone
A brand new moon, brand new sun
So follow, follow the sun
The direction of the birds
The direction of love
Breath, breath in the air
Cheerish this moment
Cheerish this breath
Tomorrow is a new day for everyone
Brand new moon, brand new sun
When you feel love coming down on you
Like a heavy wave
When you feel this crazy society
Headin' to the strand
Take a straw to the nearest waters
And remember your place
Many moons have risen and fallen long, long before youve came
So which way is the wind blowin'
And what does your heart say?
So follow, follow the sun
And which way the wind blows
When this day is done...
