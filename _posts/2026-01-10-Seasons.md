Life moves in seasons.

Spring whispers: **begin**.
Summer demands: **endure**.
Fall offers: **receive**.
Winter invites: **recover**.

But seasons don’t always arrive gently—sometimes the heat breaks, and winter comes early. We have to adapt quickly.

And each person moves through different seasons across the seven dimensions of life—and so do the people around us. Learn to recognize them, listen to them, celebrate them, and learn from them. Let different seasons call forth **empathy and compassion**, not the cheap dopamine of putting others down or comparing your season to theirs - this does not give us healthy happiness in anyway.
