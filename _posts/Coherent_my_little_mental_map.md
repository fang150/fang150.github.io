The first two values used to conflict in my mind, but the coming third makes my value system coherent—and the fourth is important to all human being only have few hours a day as well.
 1. People usually don’t want or need advice unless they actively seek it. So I shouldn’t offer unsolicited guidance (especially “you should…” statements).
 2. Sometimes, driven by my own urge to help, I feel compelled to provide perspective because I think they need it. But that can still be unsolicited—and it may reflect my own biased assumptions rather than their actual needs.
 3. At the same time, authentic communication matters. When something feels genuinely true and important, I can express it as my perspective, while leaving room for others to disagree or share their own views.
 4. I should activate #3 selectively—only when it truly matters, of high priority and time-sensitive.
