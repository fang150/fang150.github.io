P.S: No drink [x]

```
If you need a drink
Then I’m buying
If you need a minute to think
I got time
If you need a shoulder, come over
It’s all good, baby cry on mine
Mr. bossman’s on your back
You left your laptop in the taxicab, and
You’re crying in the park on your break
Your boyfriend can’t talk you down
He doesn’t understand what you’re all about but 
You’ve gotten kind of used to the taste
Don’t think twice
You don’t gotta be alone with the highs and the lows 
It’s alright to need somebody
If you need a drink
Then I’m buying
If you need a minute to think
I got time
If you need a shoulder, come over,
It’s all good, baby cry on mine
If you need a hand
I got two
If you’re in the mood to dance
I got moves
If you need a night in, a night off, a phone call
Baby I got you
Head banging on the highway 
With the tunes up too loud
That was some kind of hideaway 
And I miss it now
But you’re still keeping my secrets 
I’m still stitching your clothes
I’m still letting you know
When I made it home
Don’t think twice
You don’t gotta be alone with the ebbs and the flows
It’s alright to need somebody
If you need a drink
Then I’m buying
If you need a minute to think
I got time
If you need a shoulder, come over
It’s all good, baby cry on mine
If you need a hand
I got two
If you’re in the mood to dance
I got moves
If you need a night in, a night off, a phone call
Baby I got you
```
