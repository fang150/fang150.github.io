It was on my Xth trip to USPS—so many times that I can’t even remember how many—trying to track down a missing package. Finally, I met a USPS supervisor who followed through on every single detail in the delivery history to help me find it. It wasn’t the usual “I’m sorry, the system says no, so it’s a no,” or “You can file a ticket and see if it turns up—if not, I can’t help.” Instead, it was: “Hey, XXX (her husband), stop calling me—I’m helping a customer with a missing document!”

In the end, yes—she helped me find the package. But regardless of the outcome, I wanted to honor her—Ms. Tabitha (and of course, all the individuals who helped in the middle.).
