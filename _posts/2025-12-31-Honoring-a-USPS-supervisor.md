It was on my Xth trip to USPS—so many times that I can’t even remember how many—trying to track down a missing package. Finally, I met a USPS supervisor who carefully walked through every detail in the delivery history, genuinely trying to help me locate it. It wasn’t the usual “I’m sorry, we process the delivery daily, if you didn't receive it, then it's a no,” or “You can file a ticket and see if it turns up—if not, I can’t help.” Instead, it was: “Hey, XXX (her husband), stop calling me—I’m helping a customer with a missing document!” 

In the end, yes—we finally found the package. But regardless of the outcome, it was her beautiful deeds I wanted to honor—Ms. Tabitha.
