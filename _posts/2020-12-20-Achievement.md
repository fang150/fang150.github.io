I have met many great teachers in my life. One of them is my junior high school teacher, who gave me a book as a gift titled "The Catcher in the Rye." after her retirement. Of course, I didn't even read any single line of this book due to my lack of interest in reading books-- all I wanted to do was looking outside of the "fancy" world.  One day when I feel bored outside world, I opened up this book and found these lines on the front page.

To Chih-Hao,

The greatest achievement in life is finding out who you are and having the courage to be yourself.
