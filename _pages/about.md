<!--- > Chih-Hao Fang is a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of  Prof. [Ananth Grama](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/ayg) in computer science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/). His research interests are optimization, machine learning, and causal inference. Chih-Hao is recipient of Lynn Fellowship at Purdue University. Prior to joining Purdue University, Chih-Hao received his B.S in Computer Science from [National Tsing Hua University](http://nthu-en.web.nthu.edu.tw/) (2013) in Taiwan. After his graduation, Chih-Hao worked as a Research Assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) (2015) in Taiwan, focusing on large-scale data analyses on Next-Generation Sequencing Data. -->

I am currently a Lead AI/ML Engineer at Optum AI (UnitedHealth Group), where I feel incredibly lucky and honored to collaborate with many talented people on meaningful and impactful problems that help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone [(See our Mission & Values) ](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/uhg/mission-values.html)! Prior to that, I worked as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, focusing on search, ranking, pricing, and large language model applications.


Before joining industry, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Purdue University [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), where my research spanned optimization, machine learning, causal inference, and natural language processing. I also served as a postdoctoral researcher there. I received my B.S in the Computer Science Department at [National Tsing Hua University](http://nthu-en.web.nthu.edu.tw/) and worked as a Research Assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) before moving to Purdue.

** Coming from an underrepresented group, I feel incredibly fortunate and privileged to have been guided by amazing people. While I don’t consider myself to be particularly extraordinary, I believe I can still offer help to those in need. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdF6zivEsaKcSlGobYD0c8jicVO9tiNNzePan7S080mIikL7g/viewform?usp=sharing) to see if I may help. -->


<!--- >  ***P.S. Last year, August (2023), I missed the precious opportunity to serve as a reviewer at ICLR for some reasons and would appreciate the invites again!!*** -->

*** I am currently open to opportunities in the roles of an Applied Scientist or Machine Learning Researcher. I welcome any interested parties to connect with me on LinkedIn or via my email at chihhaofang19@gmail.com. ***

Possessing a rich background in Machine Learning research, I bring to the table comprehensive expertise in Convex, Non-Convex, and Constrained Optimization, Causal Inference, and Deep Learning. My technical acumen shines in my ability to design and implement Convex and Non-Convex solvers which streamline the training process of machine learning models. In this capacity, I have accumulated vast experience with open-source platforms like Pytorch and Tensorflow, allowing me to modify and even extend their functionalities.

In the healthcare industry, my work has been pivotal in utilizing constrained optimization solvers for disease phenotyping. This work has paved the way for an innovative interpretable treatment recommendation model.

I've also made significant contributions in the development of a causal reinforcement learning algorithm. This unique algorithm leverages causal inference principles to forecast more accurate potential treatment outcomes.

My involvement in Deep Learning has resulted in the creation of a model that outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in predicting regulatory elements.

Recently, I've further refined my optimization skills by creating a constrained optimization solver. This solver can identify pivotal features corresponding to multidimensional feature and outcome spaces. Recognized by experts in the field, this represents a high-dimensional extension of L1 lasso regression, thereby enhancing the model's performance and explainability significantly.

At present, my focus is on designing cutting-edge deep learning models to solve intricate Natural Language Processing problems. A notable accomplishment is the unique framework I've developed for news framing prediction. This framework adopts a graph-based approach that converts sentences into graph nodes, utilizes transformer models for embeddings, and extracts relationships from the ASER Knowledge Graph. A trained Graph Neural Network is then deployed to fine-tune transformers and accurately predict the framing of news articles.

In addition to my research work, I serve as a conference reviewer for highly respected forums such as NeurIPS and ICML, contributing to the shared body of knowledge in this rapidly progressing field. In my upcoming role, I aim to utilize my specialized expertise to continue propelling the boundaries of research forward.
