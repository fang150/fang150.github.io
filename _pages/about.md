Chih-Hao Fang is a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of  Prof. [Ananth Grama](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/ayg) in computer science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/). His research interests lie in the design and analysis of optimization, machine learning, and causal inference algorithms for the applications to the study of modern, massive datasets, with a particular emphasis on the analysis of genomic and healthcare data. Chih-Hao is recipient of Lynn Fellowship. Prior to joining Purdue University, Chih-Hao received his B.S in Computer Science from [National Tsing Hua University](http://nthu-en.web.nthu.edu.tw/) (2013) in Taiwan. After his graduation, Chih-Hao worked as a Research Assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) (2015) in Taiwan, focusing on large-scale data analyses on Next-Generation Sequencing Data.
