<!--- > Chih-Hao Fang is a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of  Prof. [Ananth Grama](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/ayg) in computer science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/). His research interests are optimization, machine learning, and causal inference. Chih-Hao is recipient of Lynn Fellowship at Purdue University. Prior to joining Purdue University, Chih-Hao received his B.S in Computer Science from [National Tsing Hua University](http://nthu-en.web.nthu.edu.tw/) (2013) in Taiwan. After his graduation, Chih-Hao worked as a Research Assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) (2015) in Taiwan, focusing on large-scale data analyses on Next-Generation Sequencing Data. -->


I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science Department at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), where I was advised by Prof. [Ananth Grama](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/ayg). My research interests lies in optimization, machine learning, and causal inference. Prior to joining Purdue University, Chih-Hao received his B.S in Computer Science from [National Tsing Hua University](http://nthu-en.web.nthu.edu.tw/). I also worked as a Research Assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) for a few months before stuyding at Purdue.
